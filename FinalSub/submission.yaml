description: The normalized $J/\psi$ yields scaled by average $J/\psi$ yield, both normalied by the corresponding number of minimum bias events. The results are shown as a function of self-normalized charged particle multiplicity $N_{ch}/<N_{ch}>$ in the same arms before subtracting the dimuon contributions.
